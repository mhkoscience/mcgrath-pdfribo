Ribosome force field.

Prepared for 5AFI model (70S+P/tRNA processed correctly by pdb2gmx and grompp
5.0.7)

Contains:
- amber12sb amino acids
- amber12sb inverted amino acids for nascent peptide
- amber12sb nucleotides (no update since ff10)
- uncommon nucleotides prepared from Aduri's 2007 nucleobases and amber99sb
sugars and phosphates
- terminal nucleotides with 5'-phosphate (RX5P)
- Joung and Cheatham 2008 potasium KJ and chloride ClJ
- SPC/E water

Use:
- copy amberRibo.ff to the working directory
- move residuetypes.dat to one level higher

Known (possible) issues:
- phosphates on terminal nucleotides are all de-protonated
- only two vsite types (MCH3, MNH3), instead of having separate types
for each of M-C-X pattern
- backbone torsion angle in modified nucleotides do not correspond 
to the torsions in standard nucleotides
